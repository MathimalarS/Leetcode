Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

Example 1:
Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int isPrefixOfWord(String sentence, String searchWord) {
        String arr[]=sentence.split(" ");
        int n=arr.length;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i].startsWith(searchWord))
            {
                return i+1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
